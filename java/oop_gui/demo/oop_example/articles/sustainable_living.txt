Sustainable living is a practical philosophy that aims to reduce personal and societal environmental impact by making positive changes which counteract climate change and other negative environmental concerns.

More simply, sustainable living is a method of reducing one’s “carbon footprint”. If you need motivation to jump on board, try out the World Wildlife Fund’s environmental footprint calculator. 

“Sustainable living” encourages people to minimize their use of Earth’s resources and reduce the damage of human and environmental interactions.
